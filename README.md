# Project Objective
This project aims to analyze IPL match data to uncover key insights about team performances, venue trends, player achievements, and match dynamics. The analysis is performed using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

# Key Questions and KPI's

The project seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which team has won the most IPL matches across all seasons?
-	Which city has hosted the most IPL matches?
-	Which venue has the most wins by batting first vs. chasing?
-	Who are the top 5 "Player of the Match" award winners?
-	How does the toss decision affect the match outcome?
-	Which IPL season had the closest matches (smallest winning margins)?
-	Has the frequency of Super Overs changed over the years?
-	How many Super Overs have been played in each season?
-	Which players have won "Player of the Match" awards for different teams?

# Process
## Data Collection 
- The dataset consists of <a href = "">IPL</a> match records till the 2022 season.
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
- Removing null values, correcting data formats, and structuring the dataset.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze trends and patterns.
## Data Visualization 
- Representing insights with graphs and charts.
## Dashboard & Reporting 
- Summarizing findings in a clear and concise format.

# Project Insights
- Mumbai Indians have won the most IPL matches across all seasons.
- Mumbai has hosted the most IPL matches.
- The toss decision has a significant impact on match outcomes.
- The frequency of Super Overs has fluctuated across seasons, with peaks in certain years.
- AB de Villiers holds the record for the most "Player of the Match" awards.

# Final Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into IPL match trends, team performances, and player contributions. This data-driven approach helps in understanding match-winning factors and the impact of key variables like toss decisions and venues.
